To run and test the application Mint on different templates

After creating a palletes, template and integration.
Publish this integration into maps&routes path (.camel/) 
Ater that check the published .xml file is as expectation from given in xml files 

For running test cases you to check all the related .feature file, setp files and testTemplate files which are present inside maps&routes (testTemplate/) if not there keep it ready
There are some important 
for scaling issues 
 
As the integrations are ready we are ready to test with certain input message (xml/json) and expected message (xml/json) wrt to integrations and its files will store inside maps&routes(testCases/)

1 Pass Through(I0001) -> Input.xml. OutExpt.xml
2 Basic Rest (I0002)-> (Get function) Input.xml, OutExpt.xml
3 REST Post (I0003)-> (Post function) InputPost.xml, OutPostExpt.xml

4 MXT Test (I0004)-> For the secenario we need to generate an Jmapper ip (http://52.154.218.202:4000/) which will vary from change in clusters
 Here we have to give few input.xsd and output.xsd along with new project name and project for transformation
 Next after adding the xsd's map the input.xsd to out.xsd as requirment then click on continue.
 
 Then come to mints application and the test the mxt_test integrtation with inputMxtPost.xml and expected outputMXTPost(will in string format) and then test
